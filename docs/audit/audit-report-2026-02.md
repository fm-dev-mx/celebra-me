# 📋 Documentation Audit Report: Feb 2026

## Objective
The objective of this audit was to refine the technical and visual documentation for Gerardo's 60th Birthday "Jefe Botas" invitation, moving it from a generic template to a bespoke "Luxury Hacienda" specification.

## 📁 Audit Scope
- [x] Master Plan: `docs/plan/invitation-60-birthday-gerardo.md`
- [x] Section Specs: `docs/plan/birthday-60/*.md`
- [x] Visual DNA: `docs/plan/birthday-60/visual-dna.md`

## 🛠️ Key Findings & Actions
1. **Status Correction:** All documentation now correctly reflects a `[/] Partial` implementation status, clarifying that while the engine exists, specific styling and logic adaptations are pending.
2. **Visual DNA Formalization:** A specific style guide for "Luxury Hacienda" was created, defining the color palette, typography, and textures (Leather, Cognac, Aged Gold).
3. **Bespoke Logic:** Sections like **Hero** (Nickname Badge), **Location** (Single-venue centering), and **RSVP** (Adult microcopy) have been detailed with specific implementation requirements.
4. **Consistency Audit:** Removed all traces of XV-specific terminology ("Pases", "Quinceañera", pink palettes) from the birthday plan files.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The documentation set is now **Cohesive & Implementation-Ready**. The next phase will focus on the technical execution of the ADUs defined in the Master Plan.
