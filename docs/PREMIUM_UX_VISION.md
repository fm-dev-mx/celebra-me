# 🎨 Master Prompt: Premium "Celebra-me" Ecosystem

## 🌟 1. The Vision

Transform **Celebra-me** from a standard invitation website into a **digital luxury** platform. Both the landing page and the invitations must emulate the tactile and visual experience of a high-end physical invitation (textured paper, embossed effects, curated typography, subtle transitions).

**UX Core:** We want a "static per section" design (one section at a time in the viewport) where navigation is subtle and information flows through elegant transitions, avoiding generic infinite scrolling.
