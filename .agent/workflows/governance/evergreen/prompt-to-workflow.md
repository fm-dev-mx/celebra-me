# 💎 Workflow: Prompt-to-Workflow Architect

1. **Synthesis**
    - Identify core objective: Feature, refinement, or architectural debt.
    - **Source of Truth**: Prioritize code over docs.
    - Reference Project Vision (textures, motion, typography).

2. **Categorization**
    - **Evergreen**: Reusable / Global standards (e.g., `gatekeeper-commit`).
    - **Task**: Tactical / Ephemeral (e.g., `update-hero-gerardo`).

3. **Strategic Injection**
    - UI Strings: Spanish. Code/Logic: English.
    - Performance & A11y (WCAG) checks.
    - Enforce data/UI separation and design tokens.

4. **Construction**
    - Slug-based filename.
    - sequential logic in ADUs.
    - `// turbo` for safe commands.
    - **Tasks**: Include self-archive step.

5. **Deployment**
    - Save via direct file edits (`apply_patch` or editor). Update `docs/implementation-log.md`.

// turbo

> [!IMPORTANT] Include a **Critical Reflection** block analyzing friction points before deployment.
